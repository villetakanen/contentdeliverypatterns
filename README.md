# Content Delivery Patterns in 2021

A vuepress@next powered static site generator

## About the project

Discussing with Antti Lammi, we realized that while there has not been much change in how content, apps, etc. is delivered (since CDN's, that is) â€“ the basic concepts and their pro/cons are still hard to grasp for many people in the field. This repo intends to act as a platform for examples and illustrations depicting the different options for content, and service deliver cross-sites and cross-services for the web, and apps in the 2021.
